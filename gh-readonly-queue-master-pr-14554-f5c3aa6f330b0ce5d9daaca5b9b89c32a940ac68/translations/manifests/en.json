    "canada_post": "Only contract customers can create manifests (if you do not have a contract ID that you can add to Shippo, you will get an error when trying to create a manifest). Contract customers that ship more than 50 shipments a day will need to create manifests to transmit the shipments for billing for a given day. Contract customers that ship less than 50 daily can usually skip the manifest requirement, but are encouraged to verify with Canada Post. If a contract customer doesn't close out a shipment day by creating a manifest, Canada Post may bill for & transmit the shipments on customer's behalf.",
    "dhl_ecommerce": "End of day manifests are required by DHL eCommerce. The electronic data will be transmitted to DHL through Shippo, and you will need to print 2 copies of the Driver's Summary Manifest (DSM) that is created. The DSM is a printed document that summarizes all shipments being given to DHL eCommerce for that day, grouped by product. You will need to provide these copies to your DHL driver at pick-up/drop-off.",
    "newgistics": "When a manifest request for Newgistics transactions is created, Shippo sends a \"Client Manifest Information\" (CMI) file to Newgistics. This is all done electronically - unlike other Manifest services (such as the USPS), Newgistics does not return a physical document for the labels to be scanned. Users who provide an ACCURATE manifest to Newgistics receive fewer package exceptions because the manifest provides a reference document for package level information. Manifests must be posted by 11 pm PST the day before a shipment is picked up for processing."
